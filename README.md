#The [Q]uantiative Project
  * The [Q]uantitative Project is a project driven student organization at the University of California - Merced.
  * We take a interdisciplinary collaborative to our projects that allows for members from any background.
  * The Quantiative part of our name relates to one of the overarching goals for all our projects - DATA.
    - All of our projects will produce to data which we will explore and analyze in the vein of Big Data analysis.

##The-Merced-Rover
 * The Merced Rover is a project dedicated to constructing an autonomous rover, a la Google's self-driving car, from the ground up.
 * Various practices and skills applied:
 
  ###Arduino Programming
   * For programming movement, the Arduino microcontroller is our choice. The open source mcirocontroller is powerful enough for simple movement.
   * As of now, we are currently using the basic Arduino Uno board and a Parallax Arduino Shield bot kit to study different methods of autonomous movement and envoronmental response. The best methods we finds will be tested and applied to the Rover we build.

  ###CAD
   * Computer Aided Design allows for a visual approach that assists and expedites the design process.
   * Mechanical Engineers utilize Autodesk products, such as Inventor and Fusion, for the CADing process.
   * Rapid prototyping of parts that can be 3-D printed allows for a trial-error-adjustment approach.

  ###Data Analysis and Machine Learning w/TensorFlow
   * We are collaborating with the Q Project's AI Research group whom will be implementing Artificial Intelligence to make the rover autonomous.
   * The AI Research division is currently researching the principles and applications of Machine Learning with Google's ML library TensorFlow.
