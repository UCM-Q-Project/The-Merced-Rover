#The T-Rex
  * The T-Rex is a Parallax's Robot Shield with Arduino kit. See https://www.parallax.com/product/32335 for specific details.
  * We are using this kit as a practice and research to for implementations of movement behavior codes for the Vanguard rover we're constructing.
  * To see the Vanguard rover, go to https://github.com/UCM-Q-Project/The-Merced-Rover/tree/master/Vangaurd
  *  *** NOTE: The codes in this project were mostly written in a Vim environment setup and not the Arduino IDE. The folder organization may need to be altered depending on your choice of Development Environment.
